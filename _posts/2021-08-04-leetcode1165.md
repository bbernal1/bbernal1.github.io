There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is abs(i - j).

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

My solution:  
{% highlight java linenos %}
class Solution {
    public int calculateTime(String keyboard, String word) {
        //first map each letter to an index
        Map<Character,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < keyboard.length(); i++) {
            char ltr = keyboard.charAt(i);
            map.put(ltr,i);
        }
        
        int time = map.get(word.charAt(0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            time += Math.abs(map.get(word.charAt(i)) - map.get(word.charAt(i-1)));
        }
        return time;
        
    }
}
