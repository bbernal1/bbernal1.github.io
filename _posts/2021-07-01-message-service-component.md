I am still working on implementing the message service and the message component and template. Once finished, the message template should display the message stating that the data is loading while the frontend is waiting for the data to arrive via the backend application. The backend application is written in Java with the Spring Boot framework and it retrieves the data from a MongoDB atlas cloud database.
