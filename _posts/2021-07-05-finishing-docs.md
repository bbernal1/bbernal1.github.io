Today I will finish the documentation for the flashcard backend [https://github.com/bbernal1/flashcard-backend/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/bbernal1/flashcard-backend/blob/master/README.md) and the frontend [https://github.com/bbernal1/flashcard-frontend/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/bbernal1/flashcard-frontend/blob/master/README.md). Afterwards, I will work on updating my resume with the new project and with a link to my blog.
