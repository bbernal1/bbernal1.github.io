So I had the idea of writing about my thought process and solutions to programming problems on sites such as Leetcode and Hackerrank. The goal is to improve my ability to explain code, motivate me to program more in general, and keep my skills sharp.  
The URL for the problem is https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/. This problem interests me as I majored in computer engineering and a lot of the programming I had to do involved bit manipulation and detecting the value of individual bits.  
The solution and explanation will be posted soon.
