The resolver and message service are implemented and I now have some bux fixes to do for the delete all cards button and the restore default cards button. These buttons were added because I wanted a quick way to show the persistence of the application and a way to restore the deck to a default state. After this I will work on cleaning up the readme.md files for the backend and frontend repository. Once done, I will start on updating my resume so I can start sending out job applications for software engineering positions.
