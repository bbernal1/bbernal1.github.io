Today I will work on adding a resolver to my [flashcard application](https://jpcards.herokuapp.com) which will ensure the flashcard data from the [MongoDB database](https://jpflashcards.herokuapp.com/flashcards)
arrives before activating the route. This result will be a message displayed to the user stating to please wait until data has arrived.
